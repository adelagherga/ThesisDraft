\chapter{Lay Summary}

Consider any collection of prime numbers $\{p_1, \dots, p_v\}$ and any collection of integers $c, c_0, \dots, c_n$. Our main result involves the \textit{Thue-Mahler} equation
\[F(x,y) = c_0x^n + c_1x^{n-1}y + \cdots + c_{n-1}xy^{n-1} + c_ny^n = cp_1^{z_1}\cdots p_v^{z_v},\]
where the values $x, y$, and $z_1, \dots, z_v$ are unknown. In particular, for any such equation, we know that there are only finitely many values of $x,y$, and $z_1, \dots, z_n$ which satisfy it. In our work, we develop an algorithm to find all of these solutions for any given collection of primes and coefficients $c_i$. The solutions to these Thue-Mahler have many important mathematical applications, and we modify and refine our algorithm for use in those applications.
